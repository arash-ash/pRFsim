abstract = {In this paper we introduce an empirical approximation of the log-optimal investment strategy that guarantees an almost optimal growth rate of investments. The proposed strategy also considers the effects of portfolio rearrangement costs on growth optimality and recommends a suboptimal portfolio for discrete investment periods. We do not assume any parametric structure for the market process, only a first-order Markov property. The model introduced is based on kernel-based agents' (experts') approximation of the maximum theoretical growth rate with transaction costs. Although the optimal solution is theoretically a complex Bellman programming problem, our suboptimal empirical result appears to be attractive for Dow Jones 30 shares. The paper presents a performance analysis where the return of the empirical log-optimal portfolio is compared with passive portfolio counterparts compiled from similar components using the CAPM, the three-factor model and the four-factor model. The proposed methods, in the prese...},

abstract = {Financial portfolio management is the process of constant redistribution of a fund into different financial products. This paper presents a financial-model-free Reinforcement Learning framework to provide a deep machine learning solution to the portfolio management problem. The framework consists of the Ensemble of Identical Independent Evaluators (EIIE) topology, a Portfolio-Vector Memory (PVM), an Online Stochastic Batch Learning (OSBL) scheme, and a fully exploiting and explicit reward function. This framework is realized in three instants in this work with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a basic Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). They are, along with a number of recently reviewed or published portfolio-selection strategies, examined in three back-test experiments with a trading period of 30 minutes in a cryptocurrency market. Cryptocurrencies are electronic and decentralized alternatives to government-issued money, with Bitcoin as the best-known example of a cryptocurrency. All three instances of the framework monopolize the top three positions in all experiments, outdistancing other compared trading algorithms. Although with a high commission rate of 0.25{\%} in the backtests, the framework is able to achieve at least 4-fold returns in 50 days.},
